# StepWiseRegression_R

Using IQ dataset, which contains test scores and IQ for 15 individuals. Each individual took 5 tests. The IQ is the response variable, and the five different tests are the potential predictor variables. Performs a backwards elimination on this data, then answers the following questions:
•	Which model is the best? Why?
•	From the best model, what is the adjusted R2 value and what does it mean?
•	From the best model, how does each variable influence IQ?

 Using stepwiseRegression dataset, which has a single response (Y) variable, and twelve predictor (X1 through X12) variables. Uses these data to run all three kinds of stepwise regressions (backward elimination, forward selection, and the hybrid method). After completing these analyses, answers the following questions:
•	Which model was the best for each type of method?
•	How do the final models from each method compare to each other?
•	From your chosen "best model," explain what variable(s) contribute to predicting Y and for how much variance they account.
